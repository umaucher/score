MAN.3 Project Management
------------------------

The purpose is to identify and control the activities, and
establish resources necessary for a project to develop a product,
in the context of the project’s requirements and constraints.

Process outcomes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. The scope of the work for the project is defined.
2. The feasibility of achieving the goals of the project with available resources and constraints is evaluated.
3. The activities and resources necessary to complete the work are sized and estimated.
4. Interfaces within the project, and with other projects and organizational units, are identified and monitored.
5. Plans for the execution of the project are developed, implemented and maintained.
6. Progress of the project is monitored and reported.
7. Adjustment is performed when project goals are not achieved.

   .. note::

      Project risks (using MAN.5) may be considered.

   .. note::

      Estimations and resources may include engineering, management and supporting processes.
