Base practices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. std_req:: SPL.2.BP1: Define the functional content of releases
   :id:std_bp__aspice-40__SPL-2-BP1
   :status: valid
   :links:std_bp__aspice-40__iic-11-03,std_bp__aspice-40__iic-18-06

   Define the functionality to be included and the release criteria for each release.

   .. note::

      This may include the hardware elements, software elements, and extra application parameter files
      (influencing the identified system functionality) that are needed for the release.

.. std_req:: SPL.2.BP2: Define release package
   :id:std_bp__aspice-40__SPL-2-BP2
   :status: valid
   :links:std_bp__aspice-40__iic-11-03,std_bp__aspice-40__iic-18-06

   Define the release as well as supporting tools and information.

   .. note::

      The release package may include also programming tools.

.. std_req:: SPL.2.BP3: Ensure unique identification of releases
   :id:std_bp__aspice-40__SPL-2-BP3
   :status: valid
   :links:std_bp__aspice-40__iic-11-03,std_bp__aspice-40__iic-11-04,std_bp__aspice-40__iic-13-06

   Ensure a unique identification of the release based upon the intended purpose and expectations of the release.

   .. note::

      Unique identification may be realized by a classification and numbering scheme for product releases.

.. std_req:: SPL.2.BP4: Build the release from items under configuration control
   :id:std_bp__aspice-40__SPL-2-BP4
   :status: valid
   :links:std_bp__aspice-40__iic-11-04,std_bp__aspice-40__iic-18-06

   Build the release from items under configuration control to ensure integrity.

   .. note::

      This practice may be supported by the SUP.8 Configuration Management Process.

.. std_req:: SPL.2.BP5: Ensure release approval before delivery
   :id:std_bp__aspice-40__SPL-2-BP5
   :status: valid
   :links:std_bp__aspice-40__iic-11-03,std_bp__aspice-40__iic-13-13,std_bp__aspice-40__iic-18-06

   Criteria for the release are satisfied before delivery takes place.

.. std_req:: SPL.2.BP6: Provide a release note
   :id:std_bp__aspice-40__SPL-2-BP6
   :status: valid
   :links:std_bp__aspice-40__iic-11-03,std_bp__aspice-40__iic-11-04,std_bp__aspice-40__iic-13-06,std_bp__aspice-40__iic-13-13

   A release is accompanied by information detailing key characteristics of the release.

   .. note::

      The release note may include information about legal aspects like relevant target markets,
      legislation that is considered etc. See also VAL.1 Validation.

.. std_req:: SPL.2.BP7: Communicate the type, service level and duration of support for a release
   :id:std_bp__aspice-40__SPL-2-BP7
   :status: valid
   :links:std_bp__aspice-40__iic-11-03,std_bp__aspice-40__iic-11-04,std_bp__aspice-40__iic-13-06,std_bp__aspice-40__iic-13-13

   Identify and communicate the type, service level and duration of support for a release.
