.. _naming_convention_files:

Naming Conventions of Files
---------------------------

The overall naming convention is to use snake case for all files and folders (all files are named lowercase and spaces are replaced by underscores).

.. _naming_convention_needs:

Naming Convention for UIDs
--------------------------

The naming convention for the UIDs of **all** elements shall be defined as follows:

* It should not exceed 30 characters
* It shall show a meaningful name
* It shall only consist of lowercase, digits and underscores

For the naming of the UIDs also following convention shall be applied:

* It shall consist of 3 parts separated by double underscore
   * | prefix
     | (defined in the Metamodel)
   * | structural element
     | (e.g. abbreviation for the feature / subfeature)
   * | keyword (s)
     | (keyword(s) referring the the description, separated by underscore)

As examples:

* feat_req__ipc__e2e_protection
* comp_req__kvs__storage

Only for **process UIDs** the structural element is optional:

* gd_temp__review
* gd_req__req__structure

.. _Platform_Folder_Structure:

Folder Structure of Platform Repository
---------------------------------------

The following shows the folder structure of the platform repository (ordered alphabetically). The ordering of the documentation in the rendered documentation
can be in a different order.
