.. workproduct:: Quality report
   :id: wp__qms_report
   :status: draft
   :tags: safety
   :complies: std_wp__iso26262__management_553

   | Evidence of quality conformance:
   | * Identifies what tasks/activities/process produce the information
   | * Identifies when the data was collected
   | * Identifies source of any associated data
   | * Identifies the associated quality criteria
   | * Identifies any associated measurements using the information

Process

.. workproduct:: Process Definition
   :id: wp__process_definition
   :status: draft
   :tags: process

   Process definitions.

.. workproduct:: Process Improvement Report
   :id: wp__process_impr_report
   :status: draft
   :tags: process

   Process improvement report.

Product development
-------------------

Platform development
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. workproduct:: Feature Safety Analysis
   :id: wp__feature_safety_analysis
   :status: draft
   :tags: safety
   :complies: std_wp__iso26262__analysis_851, std_wp__iso26262__software_752

   Bottom-Up Safety Analysis with e.g. FMEA method, verifies the feature architecture (as part of SW Safety Concept)
   - Detection and prevention mitigations linked to Software Feature Requirements or Assumptions of Use

.. workproduct:: Feature DFA
   :id: wp__feature_dfa
   :status: draft
   :tags: safety
   :complies: std_wp__iso26262__analysis_751, std_wp__iso26262__software_753

   Dependent Failure Analysis on platform/feature level
   - Detection and prevention mitigations linked to Software Feature Requirements or Assumptions of Use
   Perform analysis on interactions between safety related and non-safety related modules or modules with different ASIL of one feature. Including potential influences from the rest of the SW platform.

.. workproduct:: Platform Build Configuration
   :id: wp__platform_sw_build_config
   :status: draft
   :tags: safety
   :complies: std_wp__iso26262__software_1052

   Build configuration capable to create the SEooC Library for the reference HW, platform level.
   Note: Embedded software in the sense of the Iso (i.e. deployed on the production HW) is not part of our delivery.

.. workproduct:: Hardware-software interface document
   :id: wp__hsi
   :status: draft
   :tags: safety
   :complies: std_wp__iso26262__software_652, std_wp__isopas8926__4522

   | The document shall specify the hardware and software interaction and be consistent with the safety concept.
   | It shall include the platform's hardware parts that are controlled by software and hardware resources that support the execution of the software.

   Dependent Failure Analysis on component/module level
   - Detection and prevention mitigations linked to Software Component Requirements or Assumptions of Use
   Perform analysis of safety related and non-safety related sub-elements or sub-elements with different ASIL.
   Perform analysis on interactions between safety related and non-safety related sub-components or sub-components with different ASIL of one component. Including potential influences from the other components in the component's module.
