Application architectures
-------------------------

In modern software systems, the architectural design plays a critical role in determining how components interact, how they process
data, and how they manage workloads. Each architectural pattern is tailored to address specific challenges in terms of execution
model, resource consumption, communication strategy, and discovery. The three major architectures that we'll focus on — **Time-based
(Deterministic, Polling-based)**, **Data-driven (Event-driven, High-throughput)**, and **Request-driven (Asynchronous, Sporadic
interaction)** — each emphasize different operational priorities.

1. **Time-based Architecture (Deterministic, Polling-based):** Time-based architecture operates by triggering actions
   at fixed intervals, using scheduled polling to ensure consistent, predictable behavior. This architecture ensures
   high availability and deterministic execution, meaning that actions always happen at a predefined time, making it
   ideal for systems that require reliability. However, it can lead to inefficient CPU usage, as the system continues
   to poll even when no new data is available. The communication is synchronous and unidirectional, with the system
   staying up-to-date by polling for new information. Discovery is data-centric, meaning that the application focuses
   only on the data being communicated and not on the identity of the data source.

2. **Data-driven Architecture (Event-driven, High-throughput):** In a data-driven architecture, actions are triggered
   by events or data changes. The system optimizes for high throughput and performance, making it well-suited for
   applications where responsiveness to data is critical. The execution is non-deterministic, meaning that timing
   depends on when data arrives, which can lead to unpredictable bottlenecks, especially during data surges. The
   communication is unidirectional and driven by updates to data, decoupling the producers and consumers of the data.
   Discovery is data-centric, as applications react to events regardless of their origin, optimizing for low latency
   and dynamic scalability.

3. **Request-driven Architecture (Asynchronous, Sporadic interaction):** A request-driven architecture is triggered
   only when a request is made, making it ideal for applications that handle sporadic, unpredictable workloads. The
   system remains idle during inactivity, saving resources until a task is triggered. This model does not provide
   deterministic behavior, and response times depend on when requests arrive. Communication is bi-directional, with
   requests and responses flowing between client and server. Discovery is service-instance-centric, requiring knowledge
   of specific server instances, especially for stateful systems where session continuity or state preservation is
   crucial.


.. stkh_req:: Support for Time-based Architectures
   :id: stkh_req__app_architectures__support_time
