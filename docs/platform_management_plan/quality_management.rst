Quality Management / Platform Quality Management Plan
=====================================================

.. document:: Platform Quality Management Plan
   :id: doc__platform_quality_plan
   :status: valid
   :safety: ASIL_B
   :realizes: PROCESS_wp__qms_plan
   :tags: platform_management

Purpose
-------

The purpose of this document is to define a quality strategy and an approach for the platform.
This includes an approach to providing an independent and objective assurance that work products and processes
comply with predefined provisions and plans and that non-conformances are resolved and further prevented.
This document includes quality assurance activities, roles and responsibilities, goals, schedule, etc. and a
general strategy to implement quality assurance process in this platform. The quality assurance is
ensured by automated checks and restrictions, manual checks which inculdes to proof that there is no manipulation
of the workflows.

Statement of Independence
-------------------------

The :need:`PROCESS_rl__quality_manager` provides only support to the project with consulting them to improve the
quality of the project/platform product. Although the quality report is also sent to the :need:`PROCESS_rl__technical_lead`,
the :need:`PROCESS_rl__quality_manager` is independent of the delivery of the product.

3.5 Quality Management Scope
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There is no deviation from the scope defined in the :need:`doc__project_mgt_plan`. The platform and its
components are developed, and integrated for an assumed technical system, for functional safety purposes as
Safety Element out of Context (SEooC).

The development of the platform and its components follows the defined processes. Responsibilities for management,
development, implementation, integration, and verification are also defined in the processes.

The SW platform consists of features, which are based on a set of requirements and are developed in parallel.

**Tailoring of quality assurance activities**

* The tailoring is divided into project wide and feature specific rules.
* Project wide tailoring is documented in `ASPICE 4.0 <https://eclipse-score.github.io/process_description/main/standards/aspice_40/aspice.html>`_ - this is based on the development of a SW element.

3.6 Quality Management Organization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
It is the project strategy to qualify the platform or components of the platform to the appropriate international
standards and directives. Therefore the project approach to facilitate a common culture regarding quality, safety
and security is part of the documentation. The project is stewarded by the Eclipse Foundation and so the
`Eclipse Foundation Project Handbook <https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/>`_ applies.

**Project Roles**

The project roles are defined in the processes and are aligned to Eclipse roles.

.. needtable::
   :style: table
   :columns: title;id;tags
   :colwidths: 25,25,25
   :sort: title

   results = []

   for need in needs.filter_types(["role"]):
                results.append(need)


| **Critical dependencies**

The project has not implemented a quality management system yet, but aims to be conformant to ASPICE 4.0,
as defined in the management system. Continuous improvement is part of all processes. Improvements are handled
in the scope of Quality Management.

**Risk**

Organization and management system is currently not mature.

**Skills**

The main quality related project roles are the Project Lead :need:`PROCESS_rl__project_lead` and the Quality Manager :need:`PROCESS_rl__quality_manager` and these also have to have
the (Eclipse) committer role. As defined in `Committer Training <https://www.eclipse.org/projects/training/>`_ the
committers are elected in a meritrocratic manner, meaning those have to show their skills and understanding of the
project processes in several previous pull requests.

As each project can adopt additional criteria for the committers election, S-Core defines that each committer has to prove
his knowledge in quality SW development by:

- by attending the project's ASPICE 4.0 SW management and development training.

Additionally, the project repository is organized in "CODEOWNER" sections. These "CODEOWNERS" need to approve any pull
request modifying a file in their area of responsibility before it gets merged. In case of quality related "CODEOWNER" sections (e.g.
any documentation artefacts) the persons having "CODEOWNER" rights need to have:

- At least one year of professional practice of quality related SW development (or management) relevant for the section content with demonstrable and verifiable results.

The successful checking of committers and CODEOWNERS skills is ensured by the project and Quality Manager :need:`PROCESS_rl__quality_manager` and documented
in the role assignment document.

.. note:: The identity of the committer by applying the GitHub digital signature mechanism will be used to confirm the authenticity of the Quality Manager :need:`PROCESS_rl__quality_manager` role for the approvals

4 Quality Management Planning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
4.1 Quality Resources
""""""""""""""""""""""
A dedicated Quality Manager is defined as part of the cross functional feature teams as defined in :doc:`project_management`. The Quality Manager :need:`PROCESS_rl__quality_manager`, supported by the
Project Lead :need:`PROCESS_rl__project_lead`, and all other stakeholders, will ensure that quality activities are actively planned, developed,
analyzed, verified, tested, and managed throughout the life cycle of the project. As all the implementation
takes place within feature development, there is a Quality Manager :need:`PROCESS_rl__quality_manager` appointed in the feature development plan.

Resources and milestones are planned in Github Issues for all activities. There are issue templates for sagas
(covering one feature development) and for epics (covering one development workproduct each). Resource and
milestone planning is done as defined in the :doc:`project_management`.

**Tools**

The whole development and thus all work products are located in Github. The development is automated as much as
possible and follows the defined processes.

- Github issues are used for planning.
- The issue types and their workflows are described in the platform management plan.
- For quality relevant issue types the ``quality`` label is used.

4.2 Quality Management Communication
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
To exchange general information and to clarify general topics, the following communication channels are used:
- Regular (online) meetings
- E-Mails
- Messager Services e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams, Github Notifications

Ad-hoc quality related meetings are set up for clarification topics.

**Reporting**

The quality management status is reported as defined in the platform management plan. The status report includes
at least the defined Quality Criteria defined in this document.

**Escalation**

- Quality Manager :need:`PROCESS_rl__quality_manager` to steering committee documented in :need:`doc__project_mgt_plan`.

**Examples for valid escalation causes are:**

- Quality issues cannot be resolved on feature level or with the available resources.
- There are conflicting points of view between the Project Lead :need:`PROCESS_rl__project_lead`, Safety Manager :need:`PROCESS_rl__safety_manager`, Security Manager :need:`PROCESS_rl__security_manager` and the Quality Manager :need:`PROCESS_rl__quality_manager`
