GitHub Verification Report
==========================

Introduction
------------
Scope and purpose
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
GitHub.com is a cloud-based platform for source code management, project management, and automation.
It is used for hosting git repositories, managing issues and projects, code review,
release planning, and running CI/CD workflows via GitHub Actions.

Inputs and outputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Inputs:
 | - Source code (git repositories)
 | - Issues, project boards, milestones
 | - Workflow definitions (YAML)
 | - Pull requests, reviews

Outputs:
 | - Repository state (commits, branches, tags)
 | - Issue/project status
 | - CI/CD run results
 | - Release artifacts


Available information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Platform: GitHub.com (cloud)
- Official documentation: https://docs.github.com/
- API reference: https://docs.github.com/en/rest
- S-CORE GitHub organization: https://github.com/eclipse-score


Usage constraints:
 | - Requires internet access and GitHub account
 | - Actions runners may have resource/time limits
 | - Some features may require paid plans (e.g., private repositories, larger runner capacity)

Installation and integration
----------------------------
Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
No installation required for cloud use. Access via web, git client, or API. For CI/CD, configure workflows in `.github/workflows/` and connect via Bazel rules.

Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~
- Source code hosted on GitHub.com
- Issues, projects, and milestones managed via web or API
- CI/CD workflows triggered by git events, managed via GitHub Actions
- Bazel rules used to interact with GitHub for automation

Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~
- Web browser
- Git client
- Bazel build environment
