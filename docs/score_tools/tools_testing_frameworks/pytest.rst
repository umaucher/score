Pytest Verification Report
==========================

Introduction
------------
Scope and purpose
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pytest is a Python testing framework that supports unit, integration and system
testing. It provides fixtures, plugins, and multiple reporting formats to help
developers write readable and maintainable tests for Python projects.

Some S-CORE modules use pytest as a testing framework for unit and integration tests.

Inputs and outputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| Inputs: Pytest-based test files (Python), Configuration files
| Outputs: Test report (console output, XML/HTML reports), logs

  Pytest overview

Available information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Version: 9.0.3 [1]_ [2]_
- S-CORE repository: https://github.com/eclipse-score/tooling/tree/main/python_basics/score_pytest
- Official repository: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest
- Official documentation: https://docs.pytest.org
- Plugin ecosystem: https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/reference.html#plugins
- Example usage in S-CORE: inspect `pyproject.toml` / `pytest.ini` in project modules

Installation and integration
----------------------------
Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
| To add the Pytest Bazel dependency to your project or module, include the following line in your MODULE.bazel file:

.. code-block:: bash

    bazel_dep(name = "score_python_basics", version = "x.y.z")


Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~
Pytest integrates with Python projects via `pytest.ini`, `pyproject.toml`, or
`tox.ini` or via part of any other tools (e.g. ITF).

Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~
Requires a supported Python interpreter and any test-time dependencies (mocking,
test-data fixtures). CI runners must preserve environment variables and paths
needed by tests.

Safety evaluation

Result
~~~~~~
Pytest requires qualification for use in safety-related software development
according to ISO 26262.


**Tool Qualification**
----------------------
Based on method: validation of the software tool.

.. note::
  Pytest is an integral component of ITF and may be qualified either as part of the ITF qualification
  process or independently, in which case the resulting qualification shall also be applicable to ITF.

Requirements and testing aspects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pytest is an open-source framework and does not provide formal, vendor-defined
requirements. Project teams must derive requirements for the specific pytest
features and plugins used and validate pytest against these requirements.
