ITF (Integration Testing Framework) Verification Report
=======================================================

Introduction
------------
Scope and purpose
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ITF is a pytest-based integration testing framework that simplifies writing and
running integration tests. It provides utilities for common integration tasks
— for example, SSH connection setup, interpreting dataframes, parsing
diagnostic messages, etc. ITF can execute tests on emulators (QEMU) as well as on
physical hardware.

Inputs and outputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| Inputs: Software image (binary), Pytest-based test files (python)
| Outputs: Test report

  ITF overview

Available information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Version: 0.1.0 [1]_
- Repository: https://github.com/eclipse-score/itf
- Example of ITF test in S-CORE ITF repository: https://github.com/eclipse-score/itf/blob/main/examples/examples/itf/test_docker.py


Installation and integration
----------------------------
Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
| To add the ITF Bazel dependency to your project or module, include the following line in your MODULE.bazel file:

.. code-block:: Python

  bazel_dep(name = "score_itf", version = "0.1.0")

| And verify that the `.bazelrc` configuration file contains the following directive to register the S-CORE module registry:

.. code-block:: Python

  common --registry=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse-score/bazel_registry/main/

| The sources of bazel S-CORE ITF module configuration can be found at: https://github.com/eclipse-score/bazel_registry/tree/main/modules/score_itf


Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~
Integrated in bazel.

Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~
Running application software instance with configured connection.

**Tool Qualification**
-------------------------------------------
Based on method: validation of the software tool.

Requirements and testing aspects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Tool requirements are derived from official documentation (currently missing): https://github.com/eclipse-score/itf

The testing team is responsible for identifying the specific ITF functionality
used in the project. Based on this, requirements for the utilized features must be derived from
the available documentation and ITF validated against defined requirements.


.. [1] The tool version mentioned in this document is preliminary.
       It is subject to change and will be updated in future.
