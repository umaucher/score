GCC Compiler Verification Report
================================

Introduction
------------
Scope and purpose
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
GCC is open-source C/C++ compiler. It is widely used in the software development industry for compiling C and C++ code.

In the context of the S-CORE project, GCC is used as a development tool to compile software components during the development phase. However, it is not used for production builds of safety-related software components.

Therefore, the safety and security impact of GCC is "NO".


Inputs and outputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| Inputs: Software sources (C++), configuration files, dependencies
| Outputs: Object files, binaries, build logs, coverage data

  GCC overview

Available information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Version: 12.x [1]_
- Official repository: https://gcc.gnu.org/
- Official documentation: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/

Installation and integration
----------------------------
Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
To use GCC in a project, add the appropriate toolchain configuration to the `MODULE.bazel` file.

.. code-block:: Python

  # Configure the gcc toolchain.
  bazel_dep(name = "score_toolchains_gcc", version = "<X.Y>", dev_dependency = True)

  gcc = use_extension("@score_toolchains_gcc//extentions:gcc.bzl", "gcc", dev_dependency = True)
  gcc.toolchain(
    sha256 = "<SHA256_CHECKSUM>",
    strip_prefix = "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu",
    url = "https://github.com/eclipse-score/<path_to_gcc>/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu_gcc12.tar.gz",
  )
  use_repo(gcc, "gcc_toolchain", "gcc_toolchain_gcc")

If your project uses multiple toolchains or configurations, update the `.bazelrc` file in the project root to reference the GCC toolchain.

.. code-block:: Python

  ...
  common --extra_toolchains=@gcc_toolchain//:host_gcc_12
  ...

In this case default host toolchain is set to GCC and it will be used for all cc_* rules in the project.

Detailed instructions for setting up and tuning of GCC toolchain can be found in the S-CORE toolchains documentation, i.e. https://github.com/eclipse-score/toolchains_gcc

Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~
GCC is invoked by Bazel as the C/C++ compiler for cc_* targets.
The specific compiler flags and configurations are defined in the Bazel build files and can be customized as needed for different build configurations (e.g., debug, release, with instrumentation).

Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~
Requires Linux and Bazel build environment.

Result
------
GCC is not used for production builds nor during software verification phases.
The tool is used for development purposes only to support early-stage issue identification and resolution.
