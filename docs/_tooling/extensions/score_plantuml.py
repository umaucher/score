"""
This extension sets up PlantUML within the SCORE Bazel environment.

The complexity arises, as the plantuml binary is only available through Bazel.
However going through `bazel run //docs:plantuml` for every PlantUML diagram
is simply too slow.

This extension determines the path to the plantuml binary and sets it up in the
Sphinx configuration.

In addition it sets common PlantUML options, like output to svg_obj.
