Platform Safety Manual
======================

.. document:: Platform Safety Manual
   :id: doc__score_platform_safety_manual
   :status: draft
   :version: 1
   :safety: ASIL_B
   :security: NO
   :realizes: wp__module_safety_manual[version==1]


Introduction/Scope
------------------

This safety manual applies to the S-CORE SW platform, defined by its modules, see :ref:`modules`
It covers all assumed (Technical) Safety Requirements of the S-CORE SW platform and all general
Assumptions of Use which are relevant for all users of any platform module.
The specific Assumptions of Use relevant only for the users of a specific module are documented in the module's safety manual.
That means that the platform safety manual always has to be read together with all its modules safety manuals.

A platform module may contain both ASIL-relevant and QM components, see :ref:`verification-methods`
for an overview of what is required for ASIL and QM components. The applicable classification is
determined individually for each component based on the safety requirements allocated to it and
its intended execution context, rather than being derived solely from the classification of the module
as a whole. Components that are intended to execute within an ASIL context are in scope of the
applicable ASIL safety lifecycle and shall be developed, verified, and released according to
the corresponding ASIL process, see :need:`stkh_req__dependability__no_mixed_asil`.
Components that are not intended to execute within an ASIL context may remain QM,
provided that freedom from interference with the safety context is justified in
the respective feature DFA see :need:`wp__feature_dfa`.

Assumed Platform Safety Requirements
------------------------------------

For the S-CORE Platform the following functional safety related stakeholder requirements are assumed to define the top level functionality (purpose) of the S-CORE Platform. I.e. from these all the feature and component requirements implemented are derived.

Assumptions of Use
------------------

Assumptions on the Environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Generally the assumption of the project platform SEooC is that it is integrated in a safe system, i.e. the POSIX OS it runs on is qualified and also the HW related failures are taken into account by the system integrator, if not otherwise stated in the module's safety concept.

**<List here all the OS calls the project platform expects to be safe.>**

List of AoUs expected from the environment the platform runs on:

.. needtable::
   :filter: docname is not None and "platform" in docname and "assumptions" in docname
   :style: table
   :types: aou_req
   :tags: environment
   :columns: title;id;status
   :colwidths: 25,25,25
   :sort: title

Assumptions on the User
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As there is no assumption on which specific OS and HW is used, the integration testing of the stakeholder and feature requirements is expected to be performed by the user of the platform SEooC. Tests covering all stakeholder and feature requirements performed on a reference platform (tbd link to reference platform specification), reviewed and passed are included in the platform SEooC safety package.
Additionally the components of the platform may have additional specific assumptions how they are used. These are part of every module documentation: <link to add>. Assumptions from components to their users can be fulfilled in two ways:

1. There are assumption which need to be fulfilled by all SW components, e.g. "every user of an IPC mechanism needs to make sure that he provides correct data (including appropriate ASIL level)" - in this case the AoU is marked as "platform".
2. There are assumption which can be fulfilled by a safety mechanism realized by some other project platform component and are therefore not relevant for an user who uses the whole platform. But those are relevant if you chose to use the module SEooC stand-alone - in this case the AoU is marked as "module". An example would be the "JSON read" which requires "The user shall provide a string as input which is not corrupted due to HW or QM SW errors." - which is covered when using together with safe project platform persistency feature.

List of AoUs on the user of the platform features or the module of this safety manual:

.. needtable::
   :filter: docname is not None and "platform" in docname and "assumptions" in docname
   :style: table
   :types: aou_req
   :tags: user
   :columns: title;id;status
   :colwidths: 25,25,25
   :sort: title

Safety concept of the SEooC
---------------------------

The S-CORE SW platform has no safety concept additional to its module's safety concept, as it does not implement additional functionality.
The expectations towards the execution environment are described in the respective AoU, this is mainly that a safe posix operating system
integrated into a target hardware which includes safety mechanisms which cover hardware related errors.

The platform applies a safety concept that allows ASIL and QM components to
coexist within the same feature. Under this concept, the feature is split into
separate components, and the applicable safety requirements are allocated to
the respective ASIL-relevant components.

Where components executing in an ASIL context may utilize functionality that has
no direct safety purpose, freedom from interference shall be ensured between
the safety-relevant and non-safety-relevant components. This will require
All the component's functional requirements will be promoted to ASIL level to ensure
the application of the safety lifecycle. Such requirements exist to preserve the
integrity of the safety context and are applied in addition to the component's
functional requirements.

For example, the ``mw::log`` frontend is linked into and executed within an
ASIL-B application. Although logging functionality itself may only provide QM
services, the frontend forms part of the ASIL execution context and therefore
must fulfil additional safety requirements derived from the need to maintain
freedom from interference. In contrast, the ``datarouter`` daemon executes as a
separate process and may remain QM.

Safety Anomalies
----------------

Anomalies (bugs in ASIL SW, detected by testing or by users, which could not be fixed) known before release are documented in the platform/module release notes <add link to release note>.
