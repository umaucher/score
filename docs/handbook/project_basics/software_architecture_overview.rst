Eclipse S-CORE has a `software architecture community <https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-score/discussions/categories/architecture-community>`_
**responsible for maintaining and evolving the architecture**.

By creating a **feature request**, structural changes as well as new functionality can be **proposed at any time**.
All **past feature requests** are documented in the corresponding 
`Feature Requests / Modification <https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-score/projects/4/views/1>`_ GitHub project.

The **process for submitting a feature request** is described in the :ref:`contribution guide <feature_request_guideline>`.
Participation in the architecture process is encouraged.

The **software architecture community regularly organizes workshops** where contributors can: 

- present new ideas
- discuss **approved new feature requests**, and 
- evaluate whether **existing solutions** from other projects can be adopted.

These workshops are open for participation both online and onsite.
