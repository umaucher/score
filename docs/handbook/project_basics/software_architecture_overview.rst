Please also be aware, Eclipse S-CORE´s software architecture is continuously optimized and will change in future releases.
 
Eclipse S-CORE has a `software architecture community <https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-score/discussions/categories/architecture-community>`_
which is **in charge of the software architecture**.
By creating a **feature request**, structural changes to existing version as well as new functionality can be **proposed at any time**.
An overview of **past feature requests** are stored in the corresponding
`Feature Requests / Modification <https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-score/projects/4/views/1>`_ GitHub project.

The **process for issuing a feature request** is documented in the :ref:`contribution guide <feature_request_guideline>`.
A suitable **way to contribute** is via **participation in software architecture community workshops**,
which are regularly organized by the software architecture community.
**Participation** is possible either **online or onsite** (e.g. to present new ideas).
During these events there is an **open discussion** about already **approved new feature requests**
as well as about potential **takeover of existing solutions** from other projects.
