Introduction
------------

.. grid:: 1
   :class-container: score-grid score-grid-intro

   .. grid-item-card::

      Eclipse S-CORE was founded in September 2024 by automotive industry members with a shared goal:
      a code-first, open-source software platform for onboard ECUs that the whole industry can build on.

      Rather than each company independently developing and maintaining a software platform — at high cost
      and without direct customer value — S-CORE provides a common foundation with:

      - **A reference implementation** that catches integration issues early and prevents known bugs from reappearing across projects.
      - **A Functional-Safety-compliant process** (ISO 26262) applied to all modules, making S-CORE unique among open-source automotive projects.
      - **Full transparency**: process, tooling, and CI checks are open source — any stakeholder can verify the results.

      **Note:** S-CORE is not a ready-to-integrate series product. It is a generic foundation for commercial distributions.
      Responsibility for ASPICE, ISO 21434 (cybersecurity), and ISO 26262 (functional safety) compliance of the final system always remains with the series project.
