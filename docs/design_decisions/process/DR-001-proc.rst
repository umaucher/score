DR-001-Proc: Feature as Independent Delivery Product
=======================================================

.. dec_rec:: Feature as Independent Delivery Product
   :id: dec_rec__platform__feature_delivery
   :status: accepted
   :version: 1
   :Context: Feature artifacts are bound to the S-CORE platform repository and cannot be delivered independently of the platform release. The previous idea of moving all artifacts into the SW-Module repository leads to cyclic dependencies.
   :Decision: Feature artifacts are split: feature requirements and platform architecture remain in the S-CORE repository. Feature architecture and component artifacts are moved to the SW-Module repository (feature repository). The dependency direction is unambiguous: SW-Module repositories depend on the S-CORE repository, not the other way around.

   :Consequences: Process update required. Feature architecture and component artifacts are moved to SW-Module repositories. Feature requirements and logical feature interfaces remain in the S-CORE repository. The dependency rule is mandatory.


Context
-------

The intent of this decision record is to resolve the cyclic dependency problem present in the
current solution and to make features more independent from the S-CORE platform.
The original idea was to move all feature artifacts into the SW-Module repositories that
also contain the feature code. This was intended to strengthen the following aspects:

- Release independence
- Topic cohesion
- Reusability

To validate the feasibility of this concept, an initial proof of concept (PoC) was built
in which all feature artifacts were moved into the SW-Module repository.
It turned out that this leads to cyclic dependencies.
In addition, during the development of the PoC it became clear that the current solution
already contains cyclic dependencies (see :ref:`fig-current-meta-model`).
Therefore, neither the current concept nor the original PoC approach is a viable solution.

Decision
--------

The feature artifacts are split between the **S-CORE repository** and the
**SW-Module repositories** to avoid cyclic dependencies:

- The S-CORE repository contains the stakeholder requirements and the platform architecture,
  including the feature requirements (requirements at feature level).
- The SW-Module repository contains the feature architecture, the component requirements,
  and the detailed design of the components.

The dependency direction is unambiguous: SW-Module repositories depend on the S-CORE repository,
but not the other way around. The integration repository knows all repositories.
This rule structurally excludes cyclic dependencies (see :ref:`fig-new-meta-model`).

Consequences
------------

- Process update to reflect the new artifact distribution
- Feature architecture and component artifacts are moved to the SW-Module repositories
- Feature requirements remain in the S-CORE repository
- Logical feature interfaces remain in the S-CORE repository
- The dependency rule "SW-Module repositories → S-CORE repository" is mandatory
- The integration repository takes the role of the only node with knowledge of all repositories

New Solution (Alternative 3 – Split Artifacts)
-----------------------------------------------

The new solution without cyclic dependencies is shown in :ref:`fig-new-meta-model`.
The new solution follows this approach:

The **S-CORE repository** contains:

1. The stakeholder requirements that the platform must fulfill
   (black-box view of the platform).
2. The platform architecture that breaks the platform down into features, their
   feature requirements (white-box view of the platform, black-box view of the features),
   and their logical architecture interfaces.
3. The platform safety/security analysis and platform assumptions of use.

A feature consists of components. A distinction is made between:

- **Shared components** (e.g. BaseLibs): These are reused by multiple features
  and reside in their own SW-Module repositories. A feature can reference such components
  as a dependency.
- **Feature-specific components**: These are developed exclusively for the realization of a
  specific feature and are probably not intended for reuse.

The feature-specific components are bundled together with the feature artifacts in a single
SW-Module repository. This repository can therefore also be referred to as a **feature repository**.

.. note::

   A feature repository may also contain components witch are used from other features.
   Unlike BaseLibs, these components are related to the feature and are not used by all S-CORE features.
   A component that merely *implements* a Logical Architecture Interface *provided* by a feature is not considered shared; it remains specific to that feature.

The **SW-Module repository (feature repository)** contains:

1. The feature architecture that breaks the feature down into components, and their
   component requirements (white-box view of the feature, black-box view of the component).
2. The component architecture and/or the detailed design of the feature-specific components
   (white-box view of the component).
3. The feature safety/security analysis, component safety/security analysis, and module
   assumptions of use.

:ref:`fig-breakdown` illustrates exemplarily the decomposition from the platform via features
down to components, as well as the assignment of artifacts to the respective repositories.
The dependency relationships between repositories run exclusively from the SW-Module repository to the
S-CORE repository — never in the opposite direction.

Considered Alternatives
-----------------------

Four alternatives were examined:

**Alternative 1 – Status Quo (platform-centric feature management)**
  All platform and feature artifacts are located in the S-CORE platform repository.
  Component artifacts are in the SW-Module repository. Features can only be delivered with
  the platform release. Cyclic dependencies already exist today.
  → *not chosen*

**Alternative 2 – Feature in the SW-Module repository**
  Platform artifacts remain in the S-CORE repository; all feature artifacts (requirements,
  architecture, tests) and the associated components move into the SW-Module repository.
  Enables independent feature releases, but leads to cyclic dependencies, since the
  SW-Module repository depends on the S-CORE repository and vice versa.
  → *not chosen, due to cyclic dependencies*

**Alternative 3 – Split artifacts (chosen solution)**
  Feature requirements and platform architecture remain in the S-CORE repository.
  Feature architecture and component artifacts move to the SW-Module repository.
  The dependency direction is unambiguous: SW-Module repositories → S-CORE repository.
  Cyclic dependencies are structurally excluded.
  → **chosen**

**Alternative 4 – Dedicated feature repository**
  A separate feature repository sits between the S-CORE repository and the SW-Module repositories.
  Addresses the use case where two implementations exist for the same feature and
  copies of feature artifacts are to be avoided.
  Increases complexity, the number of repositories, and maintenance effort.
  → *not chosen*


Proof of Concept (PoC): Logging
--------------------------------

The **logging feature** was used as the PoC. The version shown here already implements
the chosen solution (Alternative 3).

The feature black-box view (feature requirements) is defined in the ``score`` repository.
The feature architecture and the feature-specific component artifacts are located in the
``logging`` SW-Module repository. The logging feature additionally depends on the
``baselib`` repository and the ``baselib_rust`` repository, which are used as shared
components by multiple features.
The dependency direction runs exclusively from the ``logging`` SW-Module repository
to the ``score`` repository — never the other way around.
