# DR-006-Infra: Clippy Integration via rules_lint

- **Date:** 2026-01-19

```{dec_rec} Clippy Integration via rules_lint
:id: dec_rec__infra__clippy_rules_lint
:status: accepted
:version: 1
:context: Infrastructure
:decision: Use rules_lint for Clippy in S-CORE modules
```

---

## 1. Context / Problem

S-CORE needs a consistent, Bazel-native way to run Rust Clippy across modules. We
initially aligned on rules_rust for Clippy integration, but rules_lint added native
Clippy support while that work was ongoing. We must choose one approach to reduce
divergence and keep lint workflows maintainable.

Key constraints:
- Avoid running Clippy across the entire tree by default.
- Avoid maintaining long, manual target lists.
- Keep lint rules centralized and versioned.
- Allow CI-friendly lint runs without additional tooling requirements.

## 2. Decision

We adopt rules_lint for Clippy integration in S-CORE modules.

## 3. Rationale

rules_lint fits better with the linting workflow:
- It is designed for linting (output groups, lint tests, lint-oriented UX).
- It avoids whole-tree runs and manual target lists by linting only the build graph
  of requested targets.
- Clippy support is released and tested, which reduces risk.

rules_rust remains a valid option, but it requires manual target enumeration for
lint-only runs and is harder to scope for incremental linting.

## 4. Integration Approach

Each module integrates Clippy through a rules_lint aspect:
- Use the shared aspect from `@score_rust_policies//clippy:linters.bzl`
  (repo-local aspects remain an option if needed).
- Reference the centralized Clippy configuration from the policies repo:
  `@score_rust_policies//clippy/strict:clippy.toml`.
- Enable the aspect in `.bazelrc` via `build --aspects=...%clippy` and request
  output groups `rules_lint_human` (and optionally `rules_lint_machine`).
- Skip linting for specific targets using the `no-lint` tag.
- For CI, add `--@aspect_rules_lint//lint:fail_on_violation=true` to fail on findings.
- Use `aspect_rules_lint` >= `2.0.0-rc0` to support `fail_on_violation` with Clippy.

This keeps configuration and behavior consistent while allowing each module to scope
linting to the targets it builds.

## 5. Consequences

- Clippy runs on the Rust targets in the build graph of the requested Bazel targets,
  not the whole repository by default.
- Lint rules are centralized in `score_rust_policies`, reducing duplication and drift.
- The Aspect CLI is not required for Clippy execution; standard `bazel build` works.
- rules_lint uses Aspect telemetry; this can be disabled via repo environment
  variables if required by policy.

## 6. Future Considerations

We may integrate the Aspect CLI in the future to enable the `bazel lint` command and
additional lint UX (interactive output, filtering, reporting). This is optional and
separate from the Bazel-based execution path.
