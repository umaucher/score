# DR-001-B-Infra-Extension: S-CORE Build Execution Contract


* **Date:** 2026-01-20

```{dec_rec} S-CORE Build Execution Contract
:id: dec_rec__infra__execution_contract
:status: accepted
:context: Infrastructure
:decision: Adopt a layered execution contract

```

---

## Purpose

This document defines the execution contract for S-CORE builds across developer machines
and CI infrastructure.
Its goal is to ensure **long-term reproducibility (≥10 years)**, **traceability** and
**practical hermeticity**, despite changes in underlying infrastructure such as
GitHub-hosted runners.

It builds on [DR-001], which was concerned about the same topics, but was focused on tools only. This adds details where the original description was too fuzzy.

The contract is intentionally **layered**, because different parts of the system control
different capabilities and failure modes.

---

## Core Requirements

### R1 — Long-Term Reproducibility
S-CORE builds must be reproducible for **at least 10 years** after creation, given:
- the source revision
- archived execution context
- archived toolchains
- recorded build metadata

This must remain possible even if:
- GitHub runner images change or are retired
- upstream toolchains are no longer available
- external services are unavailable

For release-grade reproducibility, the required artifacts should be recoverable without
depending on live internet access, for example via archived execution contexts, mirrors,
or pre-populated artifact stores.

---

### R2 — Traceability
For every build artifact, it must be possible to determine **exactly**:
- which sources were used
- which toolchains and tool versions were used
- which Bazel version and flags were used
- which execution context (container image) was used
- which host baseline constraints applied

This information must be recorded in a **build manifest** and stored alongside the build
outputs.

---

### R3 — Hermeticity (Practical)
Build actions must not depend on **undeclared inputs**.

In practice:
- A tool is **output-affecting** if changing its version or behavior can change:
  - build artifacts or generated source code
  - metadata consumed by downstream actions
  - CI gating results such as test, lint, or coverage outcomes
- Output-affecting tools must be:
  - managed by Bazel, or
  - explicitly injected as Bazel action inputs, or
  - represented by a declared version or fingerprint that participates in cache keys
- Documentation improves traceability, but documentation alone is not sufficient for
  hermeticity or long-term reproducibility.
- Reliance on host state must be minimized and documented where unavoidable.

Perfect hermeticity is not required, but **undeclared variability is not acceptable**.

---

## Three-Layer Execution Contract

### Layer 1 — Host Platform Contract

This layer defines the **non-virtualized constraints** imposed by the machine running
the build.

#### Scope
- GitHub-hosted runners
- self-hosted runners (VM or bare metal)
- kernel-level features shared with containers

#### Responsibilities
- Linux kernel version and configuration
- Host CPU architecture compatibility for distributed binaries (e.g. `x86_64`, `arm64`)
- Security mechanisms (AppArmor / LSM)
- Filesystems, networking, namespaces
- Support for:
  - Bazel `linux-sandbox`
  - QEMU / `binfmt`
  - privileged operations where required

#### Requirements
- Linux host OS with **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS** as the minimum supported value (MSV)
- Kernel must support:
  - unprivileged user namespaces
  - mount operations required by Bazel sandboxing
- Host security policies must not block Bazel `linux-sandbox` unless explicitly documented

#### Known Constraints
- Ubuntu 24.04+ AppArmor may block Bazel sandbox mount operations
- Containers **cannot** mitigate host-kernel restrictions

#### Policy
- The **Reference Integration Host Baseline** is **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS**.
- Temporary use of older hosts due to infrastructure constraints does **not** change the
  contract and must be treated as an explicit exception.
- Deviations (e.g. privileged runners, sandbox disabled) must be explicit and isolated.

---

### Layer 2 — Execution Context Contract (Default: Devcontainer)

This layer defines the **user-space environment** in which builds are executed.
The default execution context is a versioned devcontainer image, but a compatible native
environment may also satisfy this layer.

#### Purpose
- Provide consistent runtime ABI (`glibc`, `libstdc++`)
- Ensure tool binaries (e.g. rustc) can execute reliably
- Eliminate “works on my machine” discrepancies
- Enable local reproduction of CI builds
- Define which user-space properties must be equivalent between CI and local execution

#### Compatibility Requirements
- A compatible execution context does not need to be byte-identical, but it must provide
  the same build-relevant properties:
  - runtime ABI relevant for executing distributed binaries
  - declared tool and toolchain versions, or equivalent pinned artifacts
  - environment settings intentionally relied upon by the build or test actions

#### Definition
- A **versioned devcontainer image** is the default execution context for CI and local builds.
- The container image must be:
  - built from a **defined Ubuntu LTS baseline**
  - compatible with common developer tooling (e.g. by following the [specification](https://containers.dev/))
  - referenced by an **immutable image digest**
  - managed in a way that supports archival for **long-term reproducibility**

#### Baseline Preservation and Reproducibility
- Once a devcontainer image is used in CI, its image digest becomes part of the build provenance
- All such images must be designed to be archived and retrievable for **at least 10 years**
- Reproducing historical builds may rely on legacy container runtimes or CLI-only execution,
  and does not require continued IDE support

#### Responsibilities
- User-space runtime libraries
- Bootstrap tooling (git, bash, coreutils, python, etc.)
- Bazel entrypoint (preferably Bazelisk)
- If Bazelisk is used, the referenced Bazel binaries must be pinned and available from a
  source that can be mirrored or archived
- Development UX tooling (optional)
- Environment settings intentionally exposed as part of the build contract

#### Non-Goals
- The devcontainer must **not silently override** repository-declared Bazel versions.
- Build-relevant versions and dependency selections must remain reviewable in
  repository-controlled metadata (e.g. `.bazelversion`, module lockfiles, pinned
  toolchain definitions).
- The devcontainer must **not be the only place** where critical tool versions are defined.

#### Policy
- The devcontainer defines the **default** environment, not the **only** supported one.
- A compatible native environment is acceptable if it satisfies the same build-relevant
  contract.
- Builds should still be possible on compatible bare-metal hosts.

---

### Layer 3 — Bazel Contract

This layer defines **what Bazel controls and guarantees**.

#### Bazel Versioning
- Each Bazel-based repository relevant to this contract must declare the Bazel version it
  expects in repository-controlled metadata, preferably via `.bazelversion`.
- S-CORE should align on a **single Bazel version** across repositories that participate in
  the shared build environment.
- CI should enforce version consistency where that alignment is required.

#### Toolchains and Tools
- Toolchains (e.g. Rust/Ferrocene, C/C++) must be:
  - versioned
  - immutable
  - built against a documented baseline
- Tools that can change build artifacts, generated metadata, or CI gating results must be
  known to Bazel or reflected in declared action inputs.
- Module overrides and external artifact references must be pinned to immutable revisions
  or checksums when they are part of the reproducibility story.
- Externally fetched build inputs must be pinned and suitable for mirroring or archival
  when long-term reproducibility depends on them.
- Bazel management improves traceability and cache correctness, but does **not** by itself
  guarantee long-term reproducibility.
- Long-term reproducibility also requires pinning, checksums, archival or mirroring, and
  periodic offline verification for release-grade builds.

#### Hermeticity Guarantees
- Bazel sandboxing provides reproducibility **given runnable tools**.
- Bazel does **not** virtualize:
  - kernel
  - `glibc`
  - host security configuration

These constraints must be handled in Layer 1 and Layer 2.

---

## Minimum Supported Baselines

### Host Platform Baseline
- Minimum supported value (MSV) for the host platform: **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS**
- This applies to developer hosts, CI runners, and other environments that execute Bazel
  actions directly on the host
- Temporary execution on older hosts due to runner limitations or sandbox workarounds does
  **not** redefine the supported baseline and must remain a documented exception

### Toolchain Runtime Compatibility
- Distributed toolchains must be runnable on the host MSV or be executed inside a versioned
  execution context that provides the required runtime ABI
- A temporary downgrade of a toolchain build baseline to accommodate current CI constraints
  does **not** redefine the host platform contract
- Older host environments are **not supported** unless explicitly documented as exceptions

### Rationale
We explicitly do **not** support all historical `glibc` or kernel versions.
Portability is achieved by choosing and documenting a baseline, not by unlimited
backward compatibility. The host platform contract must not be dictated by temporary
workarounds in individual modules or CI pipelines. Layer 2 can be virtualized as needed
for future reproducibility.

---

## Build Provenance and Archiving

Each CI build must produce and archive:
- build manifest (metadata)
- container image digest
- toolchain identifiers
- source revision(s)

These artifacts form the basis for:
- long-term reproducibility
- forensic analysis
- compliance and auditing

---

## Summary

- **Layer 1** defines what the host *must* provide.
- **Layer 2** defines the default execution environment.
- **Layer 3** defines how Bazel achieves reproducibility and caching.
- Reproducibility, traceability, and hermeticity are enforced through
**explicit contracts**, not assumptions.

This separation allows S-CORE to scale infrastructure, evolve toolchains, and still
reproduce builds years into the future.
