:decision: Rust is ready for use in ASIL-B safety-critical components
```

---

## Context / Problem

At the [Architecture F2F in November 2025](https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-score/discussions/1922#discussioncomment-14891648), the project deferred the Rust readiness decision to individual modules with a February 2026 assessment deadline. Key gaps included coverage, compiler qualification, and libcore/libstd qualification.

The [Technical Lead Circle meeting on 2026-03-06](https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-score/discussions/2662) reviewed evidence and concluded that Rust is ready for ASIL-B safety-critical use in S-CORE 1.0.

## Decision

Rust is approved for use in ASIL-B safety-critical components.

## Rationale

Critical tooling (compiler, linting, formatting) is complete. Remaining mandatory gaps (coverage qualification, libcore/libstd extensions) have commercial mitigation paths available.

### Evidence Basis
The evidence was gathered by the S-CORE Rust Community and documented in [Weekly RUST Meeting, 2026-03-04](https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-score/discussions/236#discussioncomment-15997719):

```markdown
# Rust ASIL-B end of 2026 - feasibility overview

Overall tracking board: https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-score/projects/34/views/7
Mandatory scope: https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-score/projects/34/views/8

## Mandatory Scope

### ✅ Code formatting 
Bazel integration + CI/CD integration ready and rolled out in few Rust repositories that ensures code is aligned by same S-CORE wide configuration

- Verification report (https://eclipse-score.github.io/score/main/score_tools/tools_static_analysis_code_quality/clippy.html#doc_tool__clippy)

### ✅ Static code analysis - linting

- Bazel integration + CI/CD integration ready and rolled out in few Rust repositories that ensures code is aligned by same S-CORE wide configuration
- tool have available report verification with confidence HIGH, meaning no qualification needed. (https://eclipse-score.github.io/score/main/score_tools/tools_static_analysis_code_quality/clippy.html#doc_tool__clippy)


### 📈 Code coverage
Bazel integration + CI/CD integration ready and rolled out in few Rust repositories

- Using build in Rust test framework for writing and running TC
- Tool for coverage calculation used from Ferrocene 
    - Ferrocene provided offer for tool qualification  - ✅  offer available at https://github.com/eclipse-score/score/issues/2020

### 📈 Certified `libcore` and `libstd` subset

- `libcore` certified as ASIL-B in quite big scope already
- Ferrocene provided commercial offer for extension of those two in required timeline. - https://github.com/eclipse-score/score/issues/2020

### ✅ Qualified Rust compiler

- Ferrocene and QNX announced qualified compiler being available at Q3 2025 (QNX Funded)
- OEM/TIER1 can contact ferrocene for compiler offer with maintenance (around ~~25euro/mth/seat)

### Good to have

#### 📈 Coding guidelines

- Plan to use SCRCG (https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines)
- Planned availability of first version mid 2026 (not confirmed but there is good progress there)


### Dynamic analysis
`Miri` tool can be used, requires integration with bazel (some repos run it via cargo already) - planned to be done soon (**weeks**), currently no chnical > blockers
```

## Consequences

Feature teams can use Rust for safety-critical components without additional project-level approval. Module-level architecture decisions should document language choice rationale but don't need to re-justify Rust's safety-critical readiness.

## Remaining Risks

- Qualification timeline: Coverage and libcore/libstd work must be ordered latest by July 2026 to make the referenced timeline
- Assessment is specific to QNX 8 with Ferrocene compiler; other platforms need to be evaluated via the [OS onboarding process](https://eclipse-score.github.io/score/main/modules/os/operating_systems/docs/index.html) when promoting to the Certifiable Level
