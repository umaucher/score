Feature flag
============

To activate this feature, use the following feature flag:

``experimental_nonipc_com``

Abstract
========

This feature provides mechanisms for communication and data exchange between processes without using IPC.
It includes two classes of communication/data-exchange:

1. One-way data sharing into a VM for (vehicle) state read-only for the VM (snapshot state)
   - Read-only for consumer (VM)
   - Support for consistent data-sets (consumer must be able to get a consistent version of related data items)
   - Consistent access must be lock-free
   - Producer time stamps shall be available for related data-sets

2. Streamed data based on shared queues (stream of events or data)
   - Queues shall be configurable by client (VM) (number of elements etc..)
     - Size of a queue
     - Allocation of buffers for the data elements
   - Queues shall support lock-free access to data elements
   - Support for bi-directional communication via writable data elements by the client
   - Asynchronous bi-directional support via multiple queues

Motivation
==========

NonIPC communication mechanisms are essential to ensure efficient and reliable data exchange between processes, especially in scenarios where IPC may not be suitable or desired.

Rationale
=========

These communication mechanisms are developed to address specific needs for data sharing and streaming in a VM environment, ensuring consistent and lock-free access to data.

Specification
=============

The NonIPC communication feature consists of the following mechanisms:

- **One-way data sharing**: Allows read-only access to vehicle state data in a VM, ensuring consistency and lock-free access.
- **Streamed data**: Utilizes shared queues for streaming events or data, configurable by the client, supporting bi-directional communication.

General requirements:
---------------------

- Multiple chunks of shared memory shall be supported to allow required access control.
- Notifications for data updates shall be available (virtual IRQs in a VM).
- Notifications shall be configurable by consumers of data (using flags or watermarks in shared memory from client to producer).

Backwards Compatibility
=======================

As this is a new feature, there are no backwards compatibility concerns.

Security Impact
===============

NonIPC communication mechanisms present varying security risks as vulnerabilities could affect multiple components simultaneously.
Each mechanism requires individual security impact analysis based on its functionality and usage patterns.

Safety Impact
=============

- Due to wide usage of these communication mechanisms throughout the platform, extra care is needed in design, implementation, and testing to minimize safety impact.
- Mechanisms are developed at various integrity levels from QM (non-safety) up to ASIL-B, depending on their intended use cases.

License Impact
==============

The NonIPC communication mechanisms are licensed under Apache License 2.0.

How to Teach This
=================

Each mechanism is expected to have a user manual that includes an API reference and usage examples where necessary.

Rejected Ideas
==============

There are no rejected ideas related to the NonIPC communication feature at this time.

Open Issues
===========

There are currently no open issues related to the NonIPC communication feature.
