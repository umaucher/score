Time Feature Assumption of Use Requirements
===========================================

.. aou_req:: Vehicle time end-to-end integrity
   :id: aou_req__feature__veh_time_e2e_integrity
   :reqtype: Non-Functional
   :security: NO
   :safety: ASIL_B
   :status: valid
   :version: 1

   If the system using the S-CORE Time feature has the safety goal to achive end-to-end integrity of
   the vehicle time information, the involved external components (like grand master clock, any
   intermediate master clock, and time-aware bridges/switches) must support respective measures for
   the integrity protection.

   Note: If this assumption is violated, the data integrity level of the vehicle time information will fall
         back to QM and must be marked accordingly in the respective project documentation.
