Feature flag
============

To activate this feature, use the following feature flag:

``experimental_baselibs``

Abstract
========

This feature provides a set of base libraries for both C++ and Rust that can be used by S-CORE
components.
These libraries offer common functionality, ensuring consistent implementations, reducing code
duplication, and promoting interoperability between components.

The base libraries include utilities for bit manipulation, concurrency management, containers,
JSON processing, filesystem operations, memory handling, OS abstraction, error handling,
serialization, logging, and various other common utilities needed across the S-CORE system.

Motivation
==========

Base libraries are essential to ensure consistency, reduce code duplication, and improve quality
across S-CORE components.

Rationale
=========

A base library is developed only if it is required by at least two S-CORE components.
This ensures that the effort to create and maintain a base library is justified by real,
shared needs across the platform.

Each base library may provide an API for Rust, C++, or both, depending on the requirements of
the consuming components. When possible, a library should be implemented once in either Rust
or C++ and provide bindings to the other language to maximize maintainability and consistency.
However, if there are strong technical reasons (such as language-specific performance or safety
requirements), a library may be implemented separately in both Rust and C++.

Specification
=============

The base libraries feature consists of the following libraries, all of which are currently implemented in C++:

- **bitmanipulation**: Utilities for bit manipulation.
- **concurrency**: Provides a generic interface to execute any C++ callable in a parallel context,
  supporting various execution strategies (e.g., thread pool, timed execution), thread safety,
  interruption handling, and periodic/delayed task execution.
- **containers**: Offers a ``DynamicArray`` (fixed-size array with dynamic construction-time size)
  and an intrusive linked list implementation conforming to the
  `P0406R1 proposal <https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0406r1.html>`_.
- **json**: JSON abstraction layer that can switch between different parsers/serializers under the hood.
- **filesystem**: Filesystem manipulation library similar to ``std::filesystem``.
- **futurecpp**: Extends the C++14 Standard Library with features from newer C++ standards up to C++26,
  as well as selected proposals for the C++ Standard Library.
- **safecpp/aborts_upon_exception**: Globally prevents creation of exception objects by calling ``std::abort()``
  immediately.
- **safecpp/coverage_termination_handler**: Helper library to enable collective code coverage information in
  GTest death tests.
- **safecpp/safe_math**: Provides safe implementations for arithmetic and related operations for
  signed/unsigned integral types and floating point types.
- **safecpp/scoped_function**: Allows developers to consciously limit when an enclosed callable
  (function) can be invoked.
- **memory**: Utility library for memory handling, including an abstraction layer for shared memory.
- **os**: OS Abstraction Layer (OSAL) to interface with different POSIX-like operating systems such
  as Linux and QNX.
- **result**: Provides a unified approach to error handling without exceptions, conforming to C++23
  ``std::expected``.
- **static_reflection_with_serialization**: A header-only library for binary serialization,
  deserialization, and compile-time type reflection of heterogenuous C++ data structures with focus
  on compile-time safety and efficiency of serialization, as well as efficiency of filtering by
  content during deserialization.
- **mw::log**: Logging library.
- **utils**: Provides a collection of small, reusable utilities that do not fit into the other
  base libraries.

Backwards Compatibility
=======================

As this is a new feature, there are no backwards compatibility concerns.

Security Impact
===============

Base libraries present varying security risks as vulnerabilities could affect multiple components
simultaneously.
Each library requires individual security impact analysis based on its functionality and usage patterns.

Safety Impact
=============

- Due to wide usage of the base libraries throughout the platform, extra care is needed in design,
  implementation, and testing to minimize safety impact.
- Libraries are developed at various integrity levels from QM (non-safety) up to ASIL-B,
  depending on their intended use cases.

License Impact
==============

The base libraries are licensed under Apache License 2.0.

How to Teach This
=================

Each library is expected to have a user manual that includes an API reference and usage examples
where necessary.

Rejected Ideas
==============

There are no rejected ideas related to the base libraries feature at this time.

Open Issues
===========

There are currently no open issues related to the base libraries feature.
