Overview
--------

The DDS Gateway introduces a communication bridge within the S-CORE communication stack.
It enables controlled and configurable data exchange between ``mw::com (LoLa)`` (intra-ECU 
communication via IPC binding) and DDS-based systems (inter-ECU
communication), allowing integration with distributed DDS environments
while preserving existing application implementations.

Architecture Concept
--------------------
The DDS Gateway acts as a centralized communication bridge between local
``mw::com (LoLa)`` communication and DDS domains, enabling inter-ECU
communication between ``mw::com`` participants via DDS transport.

       +---------------------+

Each DDS Gateway instance connects to:
- Local ``mw::com (LoLa)`` participants (IPC binding)
- A DDS domain for inter-ECU communication

The gateway is responsible for:

- Translating data in both directions between ``mw::com`` and DDS representations  
- Routing data across DDS domains
- configure QOS on DDS for each route 
- Applying  E2E protection  


Scope
-----
The DDS Gateway provides:

- Bridging between ``mw::com (LoLa)`` and DDS via the gateway:
   - ``mw::com (LoLa)`` → DDS GW → ``mw::com (LoLa)`` (inter-ECU communication via DDS)
   - ``mw::com (LoLa)`` → DDS GW → DDS applications
   - DDS applications → DDS GW → ``mw::com (LoLa)``

- Configurable routing:

  - Mapping between ``mw::com`` events(TBD for fields and methods) and DDS topics
  - Support for DDS domain-based routing

- Dynamic Type handling:

  - Runtime type definition via configuration or via dynamic library
  - No dependency on DDS IDL generation
  - Enables data translation and consistent serialization across middleware boundaries
  - Supports DDS standard encodings (e.g., XCDR1 and XCDR2) for interoperability

- End-to-End (E2E) protection:

  - Centralized handling of Counter, CRC, and DataID
  - Validation and protection configurable per route

- DDS stack abstraction:

  - Pluggable DDS implementations via defined interfaces

- Execution and performance model:

  - Asynchronous processing using internal worker queues  
  - Support for configurable priority-based routing  
  - High-priority routes can be processed with dedicated queues and worker pools to achieve low-latency data delivery  
  - Normal-priority routes are handled via standard processing queues  
  - Priority configuration is defined per route  

- DDS QoS configurability:

  - Ability to configure DDS Quality of Service (QoS) policies per route  
  - Enables tuning of reliability, durability, and latency behavior based on use case  

Motivation
----------

S-CORE currently focuses on local communication via ``mw::com (LoLa)`` but does
not provide a standardized mechanism for inter-ECU communication using DDS-based
systems.

In mixed middleware environments:

- Integration with DDS requires custom adapters  
- Applications may need to embed DDS logic, reducing abstraction  
- Communication with native DDS applications is not standardized  
- Inter-ECU communication between ``mw::com`` participants via DDS is not standardized  
- Multi-domain DDS setups are difficult to manage consistently    


The DDS Gateway addresses these challenges by introducing a centralized,
configurable component responsible for bridging and routing communication
across middleware boundaries.

Key Value
---------

- Standardized integration with DDS systems  
- Direct interoperability with native DDS applications via the gateway  
- Standardized inter-ECU communication between ``mw::com`` participants via DDS  
- Clean separation between ``mw::com (LoLa)`` and DDS  
- Reduced integration effort  
- Support for distributed and multi-domain systems  

- Performance and determinism:

  - Low-latency processing for high-priority data flows  
  - Controlled execution via configurable worker queues  
  - Predictable behavior for mixed criticality communication  

- Interoperability across heterogeneous systems:

  - Enables communication between systems with different architectures
    (e.g., 32-bit / 64-bit, different endianness)
  - Ensures consistent data representation via Dynamic Type handling  

- Centralized handling of safety (E2E) and type management
