.. feat_req:: Communication Interfaces
   :id: feat_req__com__interfaces
   :reqtype: Functional
   :security: NO
   :safety: ASIL_B
   :satisfies: stkh_req__communication__inter_process, stkh_req__app_architectures__support_data,stkh_req__app_architectures__support_request
   :status: valid

   A communication interface consists of a combination of any number of the following elements:

   - Event-Types
   - Methods
   - Signals

   :security: NO
   :safety: ASIL_B
   :satisfies: stkh_req__communication__inter_process, stkh_req__app_architectures__support_data
   :status: valid

   An event-type is part of a communication interface and has:

   - a name
   - a data type

   The producer can assign a value to it.
   Consumers can subscribe to value-changed events of the element or poll unseen, cached events.

.. feat_req:: Method
   :id: feat_req__com__method
   :reqtype: Functional
   :security: NO
   :safety: ASIL_B

   :status: valid

   A method is part of a communication interface and has:

   - a name
   - a specified application routine with a given set of parameters and a return type

   When a communication partner issues a call to the method with the required parameters:

   #. it shall invoke the application routine with the provided parameters, and
   #. return its result to the communication partner

   A method call shall be possible both synchronously and asynchronously.

.. feat_req:: Signal
   :id: feat_req__com__signal
   :reqtype: Functional

   A client can trigger the signal.
   The service instance offering the trigger can:

   - wait for the signal to be triggered
   - check if the signal was triggered

   :security: NO
   :safety: ASIL_B
