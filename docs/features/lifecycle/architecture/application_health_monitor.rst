The most important interactions are the following:

   * - Sequence number
     - Description
   * - 001 
     - `Launch manager` configuration for the alive monitoring of the `Monitored application` is parsed. This contains for example, what is the expected interval of alive notifications,
       how long grace period is given before failing to a missed (never received) alive notification etc. 
   * - 002
     - Start the startup grace period timer to allow the application to startup, before timing out to a missed alive notification
   * - 003
     - The `Monitored application` is started. (To simplify, no startup checks drawn here)
   * - 004
     - The `Monitored application` instantiate and configure the HealthMonitor
   * - 006
     - Cyclic reporting aliveness to the monitor.
   * - 007
     - HealthMonitor waking up and checking if the checkpoint(s) have been called
   * - 008
     - Report aliveness to the LM's application specific supervision, observing the health of the HealthMonitor itself
   * - 009
     - Checkpoint sent, but not on time
   * - 010
     - Wake up and check if the checkpoint(s) have been triggered. In this case it was not, and thus actions 011 and 012 are triggered.
   * - 011
     - Trigger a failure event to the Launch Manager. This event allows the monitor react faster than waiting for the timeout to expire.
   * - 012
     - Additionally, triggering alive must be stopped
