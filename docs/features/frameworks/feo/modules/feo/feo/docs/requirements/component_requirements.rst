.. comp_req:: Application Processes
    :id: comp_req__feo__application
    :reqtype: Functional
    :security: NO
    :safety: QM
    :satisfies: feat_req__feo__application
    :status: valid

    An application consists of one or more activities executed in one or multiple operating system processes.

    In particular it consists of the primary process which handles the lifecycle, configuration and execution management.
    It may optionally consist of one or more secondary processes.
    The purpose of secondary processes is to run code in separate address spaces (Freedom From Interference) for safety reasons.
    Each process (primary and secondary) belongs to exactly one application.
    Each process contains one ore more operating system threads.


.. comp_req:: Activity
    :id: comp_req__feo__activity
    :reqtype: Functional
    :security: NO
    :safety: QM
    :satisfies: feat_req__feo__activity
    :status: valid

    Each activitiy is mapped to exactly one thread within the primary or one of the secondary processes.
    Each activity provides the following functions:

    * `init`: Initialization of the activity.
    * `step`: Execution of the activity.
    * `shutdown`: Shutdown of the activity.


.. comp_req:: Task Chain
    :id: comp_req__feo__task_chain
    :reqtype: Functional
    :security: NO
    :safety: QM
    :satisfies: feat_req__feo__task_chain
    :status: valid

    All activities within an application are arranged within a `Task Chain`.
    There is exactly one task chain per application.

    The task chain configuration defines the execution order of the activities.
    In particular it defines when the task chain is activated (typically in a cyclic manner) and in which order the activities will run.

    Every task chain may have one or multiple input service activities which will run in the beginning.
    The purpose of an input service activity is to collect external input signals and provide them to the other activities during task chain execution.
    Every task may have one or more output service activities which will run in the end.
    The purpose of an output service activity is to collect signals produced by activities within the task chain and send them to external entities.


.. comp_req:: Scheduler aka Executor
    :id: comp_req__feo__scheduler
    :reqtype: Functional
    :security: NO
    :safety: QM
    :satisfies: feat_req__feo__application, feat_req__feo__agent
    :status: valid

    The component shall implement a scheduler (aka executor) that manages the execution of activities in correct order.


.. comp_req:: Service Activity
    :id: comp_req__feo__service_activity
    :reqtype: Functional
    :security: NO
    :safety: QM
    :satisfies: feat_req__feo__service_activity
    :status: valid

    The component shall enable the implementation and execution of Service Activities, which are a means to interact
    with the outside world, e.g. via network communication, direct sensor input or direct actuator output.

    A Service Activity shall be enabled to use APIs external to the framework (e.g. networking APIs, reading from
    external sensor devices, writing HW I/O, etc.)


.. comp_req:: Agent
    :id: comp_req__feo__agent
    :reqtype: Functional
    :security: NO
    :safety: QM
    :satisfies: feat_req__feo__agent
    :status: valid

    In order to execute activities in secondary processes, the Scheduler shall use agents running in the secondary
    processes. There shall be exactly one agent for each secondary process.

    The Agent in a secondary process shall receive commands from the Scheduler, invoke actions on Activities within its
    process and report back to the Scheduler. Each Activity that is part of the task chain in a secondary process shall
    be associated with an Agent, which takes over the task to wait for a trigger from the Scheduler. When the Agent
    gets a step request from the Scheduler, it calls the Step function of the Activity.


.. comp_req:: Mapping of Activities to threads
    :id: comp_req__feo__activitiy_thread
    :reqtype: Functional
    :security: NO
    :safety: QM

    :status: valid

    Each activity shall be mapped to one thread. The mapping cannot be changed at runtime.
    Each activity's `init`, `step` and `shutdown` functions shall be executed in the assigned thread.


.. comp_req:: Application Lifecycle Phases
    :id: comp_req__feo__application_lifecycle
    :reqtype: Functional
    :security: NO
    :safety: QM
    :satisfies: feat_req__feo__application_lifecycle
    :status: valid

    The Application Lifecycle shall consists of 3 phases: Init, Run and Shutdown.


.. comp_req:: Initialization of Activities
    :id: comp_req__feo__activity_init
    :reqtype: Functional
    :security: NO
    :safety: QM
    :satisfies: feat_req__feo__activity_init
    :status: valid

    Initialization of Activities shall be done during application initialization.

    Each Activity shall be initialized by a call to its `init` function.
    The `init` function shall be invoked in the thread to which the activity is mapped.


.. comp_req:: Stepping of Activities
    :id: comp_req__feo__activitiy_step
    :reqtype: Functional
    :security: NO
    :safety: QM
    :satisfies: feat_req__feo__activitiy_step, feat_req__feo__activity_init, feat_req__feo__activity
    :status: valid

    Each Activity shall be stepped once within each execution of the Task Chain they belong to.
    Stepping is done by a call to an activity's `step` function. The `step` function shall be invoked
    in the thread to which the activity is mapped.
