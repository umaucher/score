Abstract
========

Persistency is a critical feature that ensures the long-term storage and
retrieval of data within the S-CORE. It provides a reliable mechanism for
preserving information, allowing the application to maintain its state and data
integrity over time. This feature is essential for enabling the system to
resume operations seamlessly, even in the event of unexpected shutdowns or
system failures. By implementing robust persistence mechanisms, the application
can guarantee the persistence of user-generated content, configuration
settings, and other vital data, ensuring a consistent and reliable user
experience.
